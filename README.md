# main_project
<p>This project is the final project for Computational Ecology course</p>
<p>How plankton communities adapt to new environments? What are the driving forces?</p>
<p>At the end this code will be able to calculate and compare community structures of plankton for different rates of external nutrient supplies (eutrophication) and -if there is enough time- for different temperatures (global warming).</p>
