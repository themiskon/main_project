# main_project
This project is the final project for Computational Ecology course
How plankton communities adapt to new environments? What are the driving forces?
At the end this code will be able to calculate and compare community structures of plankton for different rates of external nutrient supplies (eutrophication) and -if there is enough time- for different temperatures (global warming).
